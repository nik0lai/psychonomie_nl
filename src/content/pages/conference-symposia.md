## The usefulness of brain research in research into cognition and behaviour

This is a special symposium by the NVP scientific council

### Abstract

The brain is hot. Since the emergence of techniques to measure brain
activity, such as fMRI, there is great promise that these techniques
will have major added value in understanding cognition and behaviour.
However, there are tentative doubts about the usefulness of brain
research from various quarters. In this symposium we want to discuss the
usefulness of brain research in research into cognition and behaviour.
Does brain research indeed have the added value promised by the
cognitive neuroscience revolution to understand behavior and cognition?

The aim of the symposium is to collect arguments for and against the
**usefulness of brain research in research into cognition and
behaviour**, also to train our community to better promote our field to
the outside world (e.g. NWO, media, general public). We have invited
three speakers that have in recent years criticised brain research in
media outlets (see references below). Peter Hagoort will provide an
opening statement about his positive view on the usefulness of brain
research. **Next, all speakers will give a short kick-off after which we
will have a debate with the audience guided by a number of stimulating
and critical statements.**

## How do we learn and predict structure in the world?

### Abstract

Learning and subsequently exploiting structure in the world is central
to adaptive behaviour. This symposium brings together researchers across
a broad section of psychology and neuroscience to provide a
comprehensive examination of people's ability to extract statistical
regularities from the environment in order to optimize perceptual
processing, attentional orienting, language acquisition and cognitive
development.

### Chair

Dr. Ambra Ferrari


### Talks

- *The neural signatures of incidental and intentional statistical learning* — Dr. David Richter
- *Learning what to attend to and what to ignore* — Prof. Heleen Slagter
- *How statistical learning supports early cognitive development* — Prof. Sabine Hunnius
- *Is there such a thing as a "good statistical learner"?* — Dr. Louisa Bogaerts


## How to enhance your memory? Explicit and implicit learning in multimodal environments

### Abstract

To deal with an everchanging world we rapidly adapt to changes in our
environment. This adaptability can be utilized to improve learning and
memory. Here, we present work using multimodal stimuli and virtual
environments to facilitate declarative memory and procedural learning,
including effects of spatial novelty on learning, sensory cues on
perceptually embedded motor learning, and strategies of learning in
immersive environments. Findings are linked in terms of overlapping
neural mechanisms.

## Improving the external validity of biological assessments of anxiety -- From lab to life

### Abstract

It has been suggested recently that after the replication crisis, the
next big crisis may be the *measurement crisis*. This crisis would
revolve around the failure of many well-established psychology paradigms
to predict real-life outcomes. In this symposium, we will hear 4
renowned speakers from the field of affective science about how they
strive to improve the external validity of the lab paradigms they use to
study biological origins of anxiety and its regulation.

### Chair

Dr. Floris Klumpers

- *Reducing the Noise of Reality: Gamified VR with Integrated Real-Time Biofeedback to Control Anxiety* — Abele Michela


## Integrating the "what" and the "how" of language: The role of prosody in speech recognition

### Abstract

The comprehension of language requires understanding of what was said
and how it was said. Neurocognitive models of speech recognition (e.g.
Hickok & Poeppel 2007) often assume that segmental ("*what"*) and
prosodic ("*how"*) information are analysed relatively separately. These
two types of information, however, are not neatly separated in the
acoustic content of the speech signal. This raises the question how
prosodic and segmental analysis interact. That will be the topic of this
symposium.

### Chair

Prof. James McQueen

- *Lending prosody a hand: simple beat gestures shape what words you hear* — Dr. Hans Rutger Bosker

- *Discussion*


## Neuromodulation of motivation and effort

### Abstract

The dopaminergic and cholinergic systems have been shown to be
important for decision-making and cognitive control. It is thought that
these neuromodulators exert their effects by modulating the integration
of costs and benefits, but precise mechanisms are unknown. In this
session we take a computational and translational approach, discussing
by which factors dopaminergic and cholinergic activity are modulated and
how this might affect effort and value-based choice.

- *Cholinergic modulation of the cost of control* — Dr. Sanjay Manohar


## Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT): A novel window into cognition and neural dynamics

### Abstract

Recent hardware advances have enabled Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging
(RIFT): rhythmic visual stimulation at multiple high frequencies simultaneously, undetectable by
participants. This novel method allows researchers to probe, manipulate and track neural
processes with unprecedented granularity and specificity. This symposium will draw together
researchers from different fields to demonstrate the potential of RIFT as research tool.
