## About the conference


The __18th NVP Dutch Society for Brain and Cognition Winter Conference__ is (provisionally) planned to take place in Hotel Zuiderduin, Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands, on __December 16-18, 2021__. This 3-day meeting brings together Dutch and international scientists working on cognition, behavior, and the brain. The meeting features plenary sessions, member-initiated symposia, poster sessions, keynote lectures, the awarding of the NVP Dissertation Prize and the NVP Early Career Award, a Diversity and Inclusion event, and a social program.

This year’s conference is organized by Prof. Peter Hagoort and Carolin Lorenz from the Max Planck Institute, together with the scientific committee, chaired by Dr. Hanneke den Ouden. At the moment, the meeting is planned to be an in-person meeting, although the Society and the organizing committee are keeping a close eye on the COVID-19 situation. 


## Keynote speakers

Confirmed key note speakers are:

- Prof. Sonja Kotz
- Prof. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore
- Prof. Christian Büchel


## Call for symposia 

The Scientific committee invites proposals for symposia on any topic relevant to the study of cognition, behavior and the brain. NVP has a strong preference for symposia proposals to focus on specific questions rather than a set of loosely related talks. Proposals that integrate multiple methodologies around common questions are particularly welcome.

Symposia will feature 3 or 4 speakers in a one-hour session. __Deadline for symposia proposals is June 27, 2021__. Symposia proposals can be submitted using this symposia proposal template by e-mail to the scientific committee (<SC@societyforbrainandcognition.nl>). All symposia proposals will be reviewed and rated by the members of scientific committee and seven symposia will be accepted. Please use <a href='/pages/attachments/Symposium-proposal-template-NVP-2021.docx'>this proposal template!</a>

Agreement of the chair and speakers should be obtained before submission. Please note that inclusion of chairs or speakers to participate in more than one symposium proposal is not permitted.


## Plenary and poster presentations

Members can submit an abstract (call opens: early September, __deadline October 1, 2021__) via a soon-to-be-constructed submission portal. They can request either a poster or an oral presentation. A call for plenary and poster presentations will be send out in due time.


## NVP PhD Thesis Award

At the conference, the Society awards a prize for the PhD thesis conducted in the Netherlands that made the most outstanding contribution to scientific knowledge in the field of Brain and Cognition. Eligible candidates have obtained a PhD degree from any Dutch university/institute in the roughly two-year time span between the deadlines of the previous and current thesis awards. Candidates can self-nominate or be nominated by their (co)promotor. The submitted PhD thesis should be original work in the field of Brain and Cognition and related fields, i.e. work in those fields that would typically be suitable for submission for poster and/or oral presentations at the NVP conference. __Deadline for submission: 31 July 2021__. Nominations can be submitted via email (<TAC@societyforbrainandcognition.nl>).

## NVP Early Career Award

At the Winter Conference, the Society will award the Early Career Award to an early career researcher working at a Dutch research institution for their outstanding contributions to scientific knowledge in the field of brain and cognition. The purpose is to increase the visibility of our field and support excellent early-career scientists. The winner will receive an Award certificate, €500 prize money and the opportunity to present her/his work in the NVP Winter Conference. Deadline for submission: 1 October 2021. Nominations can be submitted via email (<ECA@societyforbrainandcognition.nl>).
