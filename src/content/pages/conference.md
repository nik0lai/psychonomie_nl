## Call for Symposia<a name="symposia-call"></a>

The scientific committee invites proposals for symposia on any topic relevant to the study of cognition, behavior and the brain. NVP has a strong preference for symposia proposals to focus on specific questions rather than a set of loosely related talks. Proposals that integrate multiple methodologies around common questions are particularly welcome. Symposia will feature 3 or 4 speakers in a one-hour session. Deadline for symposia proposals is **June 15, 2023**. Symposia proposals can be submitted using this [symposia proposal template](/pages/attachments/Symposium-proposal-template-NVP-2023.docx) by e-mail to the scientific committee (SC@societyforbrainandcognition.nl). All symposia proposals will be reviewed and rated by the members of scientific committee and seven symposia will be accepted. Please use the proposal template! 

Agreement of the chair and speakers should be obtained before submission. Please note that inclusion of chairs or speakers to participate in more than one symposium proposal is not permitted. Please note that each speaker is only permitted to give one talk or present one poster at the event.
