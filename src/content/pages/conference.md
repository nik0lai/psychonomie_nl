## About the conference

The **19th NVP Dutch Society for Brain and Cognition Winter Conference** takes place in Hotel Zuiderduin, Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands, on **December 14-16, 2023**. This 3-day meeting brings together Dutch and international scientists working on cognition, behavior and the brain, and features plenary sessions, member-initiated symposia, poster sessions, keynote lectures, the awarding of the NVP Dissertation Prize and the NVP Early Career Award, and a social program. 

This year’s conference is organized by Prof. Peter Hagoort (Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics), Tildie Stijns (Radboud University), together with the scientific committee, chaired by Dr. Henk van Steenbergen (Leiden University). 

## Keynote speakers

Confirmed key note speakers are: 

- Michael Inzlicht (University of Toronto)
- Valerie Voon (Cambridge University)
- Eiko Fried (Leiden University) 
- Nienke Atteveldt (VU University)

## Call for Symposia<a name="symposia-call"></a>

The scientific committee invites proposals for symposia on any topic relevant to the study of cognition, behavior and the brain. NVP has a strong preference for symposia proposals to focus on specific questions rather than a set of loosely related talks. Proposals that integrate multiple methodologies around common questions are particularly welcome. Symposia will feature 3 or 4 speakers in a one-hour session. Deadline for symposium submission is extended to **July 7, 2023**. Symposia proposals can be submitted using this [symposia proposal template](/pages/attachments/Symposium-proposal-template-NVP-2023.docx) by e-mail to the scientific committee (SC@psychonomie.nl). All symposia proposals will be reviewed and rated by the members of scientific committee and seven symposia will be accepted. Please use the proposal template! 

Agreement of the chair and speakers should be obtained before submission. Please note that inclusion of chairs or speakers to participate in more than one symposium proposal is not permitted. Please note that each speaker is only permitted to give one talk or present one poster at the event.

## Call for Plenary Events

We are also open to receiving proposals for plenary events that facilitate discussions on current trends, for example the utilization of artificial intelligence in research, sustainable research practices, the impact of climate change on research, and ways to promote inclusivity in our research community. Deadline for plenary event proposals is extended to July 7, 2023 and can be sent by e-mail to the organizing committee (OC@psychonomie.nl). 

## Plenary and poster presentations

Members can submit an abstract (call opens: early September, deadline: October 1, 2023) via the conference website. They can request either a poster or an oral presentation. Please note that each speaker is only permitted to give one talk or present one poster at the event. A call for plenary and poster presentations will be send out in due time.

## NVP PhD Thesis Award

At the conference, the Society awards a prize for the PhD thesis conducted in the Netherlands that made the most outstanding contribution to scientific knowledge in the field of Brain and Cognition. Eligible candidates have obtained a PhD degree from any Dutch university/institute in the roughly two-year time span between the deadlines of the previous and current thesis awards. Candidates can self-nominate or be nominated by their (co)promotor. The submitted PhD thesis should be original work in the field of Brain and Cognition and related fields, i.e. work in those fields that would typically be suitable for submission for poster and/or oral presentations at the NVP conference. Deadline for submission: 31 July 2023. Nominations can be submitted via email (TAC@psychonomie.nl). More information and eligibility criteria [here](/pages/dissertation-award/)). 

## NVP Early Career Award

At the Winter Conference, the Society will award the Early Career Award to an early career researcher working at a Dutch research institution for their outstanding contributions to scientific knowledge in the field of brain and cognition. The purpose is to increase the visibility of our field and support excellent early-career scientists. The winner will receive an Award certificate, €500 prize money and the opportunity to present her/his work in the NVP Winter Conference. Deadline for submission: 1 October 2023. Nominations can be submitted via email (OC@psychonomie.nl). More information and eligibility criteria [here](/pages/early-career-award/)).
