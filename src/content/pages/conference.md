## Announcements


### Sign up for meet the professor!

As in previous years, we are organizing an event during the NVP Winter Conference where full professors and students (master and PhD) can meet.

During the lunch on December 15, PhD students and post-docs have the opportunity for a free-wheeling, open-ended discussion with the professors and senior PIs of our society. You might chat about science, building a career, or whatever comes up. The event will consist of two 30-minute sessions during lunch on Friday from 12.30 to 13.30.

If you are interested in taking part, please sign up via the link below!

### Symposia


__Schemas and schema-mediated memory__

We constantly need to structure the incoming stream of new information to accurately represent our knowledge and experiences in memory. Nearly a century ago, influential theories from Piaget and Bartlett already suggested that we remember by structuring related information into schemas, and that we continuously assimilate new information into these schemas. In this symposium, we will present neuroscientific research that investigates the nature of schematic representations and how schemas influence memory, and outline research findings that show the use of schemas for education.

Speakers:

- Silvy Collin
- Marlieke van Kesteren
- Lisa Genzel
- Roland Benoit


__Diverse approaches to move from exploring the neural correlates of consciousness to its mechanistic causes__

For decades, researchers have attempted to identify the neural correlates of consciousness. However, the scientific end goal is not to find mere correlates, but instead identify the mechanisms underlying consciousness. To do so, it has recently been argued that one should aim to separate consciousness from its prerequisites and consequences. In this symposium we explore how various internal and external factors affect fluctuations in conscious perception, with the aim to separate the neural mechanism underlying consciousness itself from its prerequisites and consequences.

Speakers:

- Maartje de Jong
- Simon van Gaal
- Nadine Dijkstra
- Johannes Fahrenfort


__Predictive cognition – the role of prediction in perception, attention and action__

Humans have the ability to detect, extract and use regularities in the environment to guide current behavior. The probabilistic structure of the world allows us to predict the future – affecting perception, action and decision making. While the behavioral benefits of successful prediction are obvious, it is still hotly debated when, where and how prediction impacts on perception, attention and cognition. In this symposium, we will examine these debates.

Speakers:

- Heleen Slagter
- Jan Theeuwes
- Clare Press
- Floris de Lange


__A nose for life!__

*A symposium honouring prof dr E.P. Köster for his role in instigating and developing Olfactory Psychological Science in the Netherlands.*

Thanks to prof dr E.P. (‘Ep’) Köster, the Netherlands knows a long tradition and international reputation in olfactory research, with a focus on perception and behaviour. Ep’s great contribution is recognised by the recently founded interdisciplinary group of olfactory scientists, NOSE (Netherlands Olfactory Science Exchange) who wish to honour Ep by organising this symposium. Many of his former students are now still active in fields related to perception psychology, often in a food or olfaction context, in companies and universities both in the Netherlands and abroad.

Speakers:

- Per Møller
- Sanne Boesveldt
- Rene de Wijk & Garmt Dijksterhuis
- Maria Larsson


__Theory, reproducibility and rigor: shaping the future of science__

Psychological science is going through turbulent times: our communities are increasingly aware of the need for improved research practices. How do we do science that’s more open, robust and reproducible, and leads to greater insight? In this symposium, four speakers will present diverse perspectives, including how greater statistical and theoretical rigour, and building effective large-scale collaborative communities, may pave the way for the next generation of constructive scientific practices.

Speakers:

- Marjan Bakker
- Iris van Rooij
- Christina Bergmann
- Anne Urai


__New computational approaches to understanding developmental changes in learning and decision-making__

Learning and decision-making strategies clearly change over the course of development, but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. To address this issue, researchers have recently turned to computational modeling. This symposium will feature the work of four researchers taking complementary computational approaches to attain a mechanistic understanding of developmental changes in experience-based learning during the transition from childhood to adulthood.

Speakers:

- Anna van Duijvenvoorde
- Rasmus Bruckner
- Marieke Jepma
- Ili Ma


__Computational modelling of abnormal decision-making and learning: Where neuroscience meets psychiatry__

Computational modelling has become a popular method to understand brain and behaviour in a quantitative theory-driven fashion. Computational psychiatry investigates how basic cognition is altered in psychiatric disorders through the rigor of mathematical modelling. This symposium showcases 4 modelling approaches explaining how people make decisions (Vassena, Kalenscher) and learn from rewards and punishments (Lesage, Pike), and how these processes may be altered in psychiatric disorders.

Speakers:

- Eliana Vassena
- Tobias Kalenscher
- Elise Lesage
- Alexandra Pike


__The influence of gut-immune axis on neuro-cognitive measures in healthy volunteers__

In this symposium we discuss evidence for the gut-immune-brain axis as a driver of cognitive processes such as emotional and cognitive control. The 4 talks will cover behavioural and imaging results in healthy volunteers. We will report variance in gut microbial composition associated with neural resting state networks in healthy volunteers, as well as behavioural effects of a range of real-life interventions in the gut microbiome and immune system; pro-, pre-biotics and vaccination.

Speakers:

- Nils Kohn
- Leonie Balter
- Laura Steenbergen
- Mirjam Bloemendaal
