## About the conference

We are pleased to announce that the __18th NVP Winter Conference on Brain and Cognition__ will be an in-person meeting that will take place in Hotel Zuiderduin, Egmond aan Zee, from __April 28-30, 2022__. This 3-day meeting brings together Dutch and international scientists working on cognition, behaviour and the brain, and features four keynote lectures, member-initiated symposia, parallel oral sessions, poster sessions, the awarding of NVP awards, and a social programme. We follow the governmental Covid-regulations and will require that you provide a [covid-certificate](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-certificate): either a proof of vaccination, a proof of recovery, or a recent negative test. You can use the Dutch __CoronaCheck app__ for this.

This year’s conference is organized by Prof. Peter Hagoort and Carolin Lorenz from the Max Planck Institute, together with the scientific committee, chaired by Dr. Hanneke den Ouden. At the moment, the meeting is planned to be an in-person meeting, although the Society and the organizing committee are keeping a close eye on the COVID-19 situation.

## NVP PhD Thesis Award

At the conference, the Society awards a prize for the PhD thesis conducted in the Netherlands that made the most outstanding contribution to scientific knowledge in the field of Brain and Cognition. Eligible candidates have obtained a PhD degree from any Dutch university/institute in the roughly two-year time span between the deadlines of the previous and current thesis awards. Candidates can self-nominate or be nominated by their (co)promotor. The submitted PhD thesis should be original work in the field of Brain and Cognition and related fields, i.e. work in those fields that would typically be suitable for submission for poster and/or oral presentations at the NVP conference. __Deadline for submission: 31 July 2021__. Nominations can be submitted via email (<TAC@societyforbrainandcognition.nl>).

For more information and eligibility criteria, see <a href="/dissertation-award">this page</a>.


## NVP Early Career Award

At the Winter Conference, the Society will award the Early Career Award to an early career researcher working at a Dutch research institution for their outstanding contributions to scientific knowledge in the field of brain and cognition. The purpose is to increase the visibility of our field and support excellent early-career scientists. The winner will receive an Award certificate, €500 prize money and the opportunity to present her/his work in the NVP Winter Conference. Deadline for submission: 1 October 2021. Nominations can be submitted via email (<ECA@societyforbrainandcognition.nl>).
